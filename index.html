            Hi, I'm Arttu, a game programmer on my final year at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, studying Information and Communication Technology (Bachelor's degree).
            I have a burning passion for games, and I enjoy learning about technologies related to game and more traditional software design, even if I don't end up using them for anything more than a few personal projects.
            I'm most familiar with Unity both from my work in school and personal projects. I even developed and released a project with a team of friends on itch.io

                <p>
                    Pump Chumps is a game my friends and I developed in the summer of 2021. It is a third-person
                    "<i>Gas Station Simulator</i>" with 3d graphics and online coop.
                    I worked mainly as a programmer along with contributing to the shaders and map design. We built the game
                    using Unity, and the Photon Pun package for the networking. I learned a lot from this project and got
                    a lot of positive feedback from players.
                </p>
