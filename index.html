            Hi, I'm Arttu, a recent graduate in Information and Communication Technology (Bachelor of Engineering), with a professional major in Game Applications. I studied at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.
            I have a burning passion for games, and I enjoy learning about technologies related to game and more traditional software design, even if I don't end up using them for anything more than a few personal projects.
            I'm most familiar with Unity both from work, school, and personal projects. Below you can see my main projects. I am currently looking for work, <a href="mailto:arttusalin1+GithubContact@gmail.com">contact me</a>

                <p>
                    Pump Chumps is a game my friends and I developed in the summer of 2021. It is a third-person
                    "<i>Gas Station Simulator</i>" with 3d graphics and online coop.
                    I worked mainly as a programmer along with contributing to the shaders and map design. We built the game
                    using Unity, and the Photon Pun package for the networking. I learned a lot from this project and got
                    a lot of positive feedback from players.

                <p>
                    News Reacts is an open world adventure game, which I worked on as a contract worker. I worked largely on the animation system and a web integration where the ingame billboard images can be changed through a website. This work helped me develop my planning and scheduling skills along with giving valuable development experience.
